[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/manuzhang/mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manuzhang/mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

*A [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) plugin that validates URLs, including anchors, in rendered html files*.

## Installation

0. Prerequisites

* Python >= 3.6
* MkDocs >= 0.17

1. Install the package with pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin
```

2. Enable the plugin in your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - htmlproofer
```

Optionally, you may raise error and fail the build on bad url status.

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - htmlproofer:
        raise_error: True
```

That can be switched off for combinations of urls (`'*'` means all urls) and status codes with `raise_error_excludes`.

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - htmlproofer:
        raise_error: True
        raise_error_excludes: 
          504: ['https://www.mkdocs.org/']
          404: ['https://github.com/manuzhang/mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin']
          400: ['*']
```

> **Note:** If you have no `plugins` entry in your config file yet, you'll likely also want to add the `search` plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is no `plugins` entry set, but now you have to enable it explicitly.

More information about plugins in the [MkDocs documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/)
