# First Nested Test Page

This plugin can detect invalid anchor links to another page, such as 
[Acknowledgement](../index.md#BAD_ANCHOR) but allows valid anchors such as
[Main Page](../index.md#mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin) and
[Table of Contents](../index.md#table-of-contents).

Invalid anchor links to nested pages will also be detected, 
[Invalid Anchor](./page2.md#BAD_ANCHOR).
